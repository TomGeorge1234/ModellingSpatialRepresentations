# Modelling Spatial Behaviour

In this tutorial ([modelling_spatial_representations.ipynb](modelling_spatial_representations.ipynb)) - designed for the TReND Comp Neuro and ML summer school 2023 - we will get hands on learning how to model spatial behaviour in continuous environments and the spatial representationtions (place cells, grid cells, head direction cells etc.) underpinning this behaviour in the brain. Here's the plan: 

1. Construct complex 2D environments and simulate agents exploring these environments under various behavioural policies. 
2. Make spatial representations (pace cells, grid cells) and generate data for these as the agent explores.
3. Build a simple model of the brain where grid cells sum together to make place cells. 

We recommend cloning and running on your local IDE (it isn't compute heavy and won't require GPUs), but you can also run remotely on Google colab here [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TomGeorge1234/ModellingSpatialRepresentations/blob/master/modelling_spatial_representations.ipynb).
